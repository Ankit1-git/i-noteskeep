NotesKeep - Your Notes on the GO!
Developed a secure Node.js project with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for user registration login and session management. Integrated user authentication with appropriate hashing algorithms and encryption techniques to ensure data privacy and security. Implemented token-based authorization for accessing CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations on notes.

Features
Here're some of the project's best features:

Designed and implemented a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to enable user registration login and session management. Users can securely create an account by providing their credentials and upon successful registration a unique JWT is generated and sent back to the client. Integrated advanced hashing algorithms and encryption techniques to securely store user passwords in the database. Token-based authentication allows users to access protected routes and perform CRUD operations on their notes.

Implemented a robust API to handle CRUD operations for note management in the Node.js project. Users can easily add new notes by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint. The note is securely stored in the database and associated with the user's account.

Ensured the safety and privacy of user data by implementing a delete operation for notes. Users can send a DELETE request to remove a specific note from their collection.

Enhanced user experience by providing alert messages for successful operations such as user registration login note addition and updates or deletions. Ensured security by implementing a session-based approach requiring users to log back in after logging out to prevent unauthorized access.
